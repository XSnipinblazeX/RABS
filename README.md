# RABS


RABS or RBAS either way same thing:

Realistic Armor Bullet Simulations

This is a system that I am working on to simulate the real life events and sh*t that real bullets do.

This system does:

Realistic thickness calculations (Line of Sight Thickness)
Realistic Bullet ballistics (bullet drop, drag, penetration, KE, etc)

Real work calculations that calculate

-Atmosphere and Air Physics
-Bullet Penetration Based on Bullet Length, Caliber, Density, Material, and same thing for the target


Please note: Once this system is complete and fully ready for sale, I will remove this github and it may be found on the Unity Asset Store or Itch.io,
until then it is currently free to everybody.

If you are using this system in your project, please credit me in your game. Thanks in advance!
